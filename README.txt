# Step-1
## Before develop, your platform must have the following softwares installed
	1) Node.js
	2) Android SDK (to develop android apk)
	3) XCode (to develop IOS application)

# Step-2
## Type in your terminal (or) command prompt
	1) npm install -g react-native-cli
	2) cd CookingGuide (goto CookingGuide folder's location)
	3) npm install
	4) react-native run-android (for android)
	5) react-native run-ios (for iOS)

#Conclusion
	If you want to develop iOS application, you platform must have MacOS and Xcode. If you 	want to develop Android application, you don't have specified platform (all platform support).
